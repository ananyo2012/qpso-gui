# QPSO GUI
This a Matlab GUI designed to simulate the QPSO algorithm.

To run the GUI you can use any of these methods below.

1. Open the folder in Matlab and type `run gui` in the Command window.  **OR**
2. Right click on **gui.fig** and choose _Open in GUIDE_.After the fig file opens choose the _Run_ button or Press _Ctrl+T_  **OR**
3. Simply open the **gui.m** file and Press the Run button or _F5_.this is perhaps the most simplest method!

Once the GUI starts you will have to enter the different values needed to run the algorithm and Press the **Execute** button. You will see the _Plot of Mean data vs. no of iterations_ after some time and the relevant outputs.
